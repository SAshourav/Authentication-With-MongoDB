# Authentication and Authorization System

This project implements a secure and scalable **authentication and authorization system** using modern web development practices. Below are the details of the technologies and techniques used.

## Features
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for stateless authentication.
- **Secure cookie storage** for managing JWTs using `cookie-parser`.
- **Password hashing and salting** with `bcrypt` for secure user credential storage.
- Role-based access control for efficient user authorization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. JWT (JSON Web Token) for Authentication
We used **JWT** to manage user authentication and transmit data securely between the client and server. The benefits include:
- Stateless session management.
- Enhanced security with digitally signed tokens.
- Flexibility for role-based and permission-based access control.

### 2. Secure Cookie Storage
To store JWTs, we employed cookies for client-side storage. The **`cookie-parser`** middleware was used to:
- Parse cookies in incoming HTTP requests.
- Securely store tokens with attributes like `HttpOnly` and `Secure` for added protection.

### 3. Password Hashing with Salt System (bcrypt)
Passwords are stored securely using the **bcrypt** algorithm with salting. Salting ensures:
- Unique hashes for identical passwords.
- Protection against brute force and rainbow table attacks.

Key advantages of bcrypt:
- Automatic salting integrated into the algorithm.
- Adaptive hashing to scale security with computational advancements.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Workflow
- **Authentication:** Users log in with their credentials, which are validated against hashed and salted passwords in the database. A JWT is issued upon successful validation and stored in a secure cookie.
- **Authorization:** Each token contains claims (e.g., roles, permissions) to restrict access to protected resources based on user roles.

## Benefits of This System
1. **Secure User Sessions:** Combines JWT and cookies to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate CSRF attacks.
2. **Scalability:** Stateless JWTs eliminate the need for server-side session storage.
3. **Modern Security Practices:** Bcrypt hashing, token-based authentication, and secure cookie handling ensure compliance with industry standards.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing and salting passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for generating and verifying JWTs.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies.
